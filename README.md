# Blender projects
Here are the projects that I created using Blender 3D. Unfortunately, they do not contain the original .blend files, as I lost them. However, I have preserved the rendered images of each project, which showcase the final results. These renders represent my early progress and creative exploration in 3D modeling, and I plan to continue building more complex and realistic models in the future.
